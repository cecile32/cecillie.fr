Hey there, put yourself at ease, pick a drink, and let’s talk.

I’m Cécile, a global art and creative director in Paris, works now in freelance. I specialize in creative strategy and conception and I help you bring emotion, depth and consistency to your brand. And I hate uppercase. Sorry.

For 15 years I’ve been glad to work with talented folks at Ultranoir, Publicis, Uzful... For some nice brands such as [Galeries Lafayette](https://www.behance.net/gallery/74355515/galeries-lafayette), [Dior](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73040331/dior-backstage), [Leroy Merlin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/74693899/du-cot-de-chez-vous), [Bayard Jeunesse](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73864429/bayard-jeunesse) and many more.

Take a look at [my Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/cecile.ricordeau/ "Instagram Cécile Ricordeau") or my [PDF book](http://bitly.com/cecillie "Book Cécile Ricordeau"), check my [Behance portfolio](https://www.behance.net/cecillie "Behance Cécile Ricordeau"), and [contact me](mailto:hello@cecillie.fr "Contact Cécile Ricordeau") if you want to discuss or pick another drink.
