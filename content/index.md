Hey there, Put yourself at ease, pick a drink, and let's talk.

I'm Cécile, a creative director in Paris. I specialize in creative strategy and believe in the power of a good and human creative process. And I hate uppercase. Sorry.

For 15 years i've been glad to work with talented folks at Ultranoir, Nurun Razorfish, Digitas... For some nice brands such as Dior, Leroy Merlin, The Kooples, Sony, Galeries Lafayette and many more.

Right now I'm creative director of Uzful, an independant agency specialized in brand engagement. I'm also a proud member of the Ethical Designer's association and a picky judge at theFWA. ✊
