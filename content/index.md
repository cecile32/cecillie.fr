Hey there, put yourself at ease, pick a drink, and let’s talk.

I’m Cécile, a creative and art director in Paris, works now in freelance. I specialize in creative strategy and conception, UI and UX, and believe in the power of a good and human creative process. And I hate uppercase. Sorry.

For 15 years I’ve been glad to work with talented folks at Ultranoir, Publicis, Uzful... For some nice brands such as [Galeries Lafayette](https://www.behance.net/gallery/74355515/galeries-lafayette), [Dior](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73040331/dior-backstage), [Leroy Merlin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/74693899/du-cot-de-chez-vous), [Bayard Jeunesse](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73864429/bayard-jeunesse) and many more.

Take a look at my [PDF book](http://bitly.com/cecillie), check my [Behance portfolio](https://www.behance.net/cecillie), and [contact me](mailto:hello@cecillie.fr) if you want to discuss or pick another drink.
