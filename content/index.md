Hey there, put yourself at ease, pick a drink, and let’s talk.

I’m Cécile, a creative and art director in Paris. I specialize in creative strategy and believe in the power of a good and human creative process. And I hate uppercase. Sorry.

For 15 years i’ve been glad to work with talented folks at Ultranoir, Publicis Nurun, Digitas... For some nice brands such as Dior, Leroy Merlin, The Kooples, Sony, Galeries Lafayette and many more.

Right now I’m creative director of [Uzful](https://www.uzful.fr) and I’m looking for new challenges. I’m also a proud member of the [Ethical Designer’s association](https://designersethiques.org) and a picky judge at [theFWA](https://thefwa.com). ✊
