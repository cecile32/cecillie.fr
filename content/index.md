Hey there, put yourself at ease, pick a drink, and let’s talk.

I’m Cécile, a creative and art director in Paris, works now in freelance. I specialize in creative strategy and conception, and believe in the power of a good and human creative process. And I hate uppercase. Sorry.

For 15 years I’ve been glad to work with talented folks at Ultranoir, Publicis Nurun, Digitas, Uzful... For some nice brands such as [Galeries Lafayette](https://www.behance.net/gallery/74355515/galeries-lafayette), [Dior](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73040331/dior-backstage), [Leroy Merlin](https://www.behance.net/gallery/74693899/du-cot-de-chez-vous), [Bayard Jeunesse](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73864429/bayard-jeunesse) and many more.

I’m also a proud member of the [Ethical Designer’s association](https://designersethiques.org) and a picky judge at [theFWA](https://thefwa.com). ✊

Take a look at my [Behance portfolio](https://www.behance.net/cecillie), check [my resume](https://www.cecillie.fr/cecile-ricordeau-cv.pdf), and [contact me](mailto:hello@cecillie.fr) if you want to discuss or pick another drink.
